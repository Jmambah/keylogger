## :notebook: **My simple keylogger project**
A simple keylogger that arranges the logs according to usernames and operating systems (OS). Each time the python file runs, it creates a text file with a timestamp to print and keep all the keys that are pressed.

## :wave: **Introduction**
The goal of this project is to essentially learn Python and apply cybersecurity to my programming abilities.

## :computer: **Installation**
To install this keylogger, follow these steps:

#### :arrow_double_down: Installing your dependencies on your Linux or Windows distribution is the first step. You will need :
1. Python (For linux : **`sudo apt install python`**)
2. Pip (For linux : **`sudo apt install pip`**)
3. pynput (For linux : **`pip install pynput`**) OR (**`python -m pip install pynput`**)

#### :floppy_disk: After those previous steps, you only need to clone this repository to your local computer:

1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/Jmambah/keylogger.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd keylogger`**

## :beginner: **Usage**
To use Project Title, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
2. In the root repository, run the command **`python ./keylogger.py`**

## :white_check_mark: TODO List

- [x] Basic keyboard input recorder.
- [x] Write recorded keys into a text file.
- [ ] Refactor and optimisation for text clarity.
- [ ] Make it autorun from an USB key.
- [ ] Be sure to be in "stealth" mode while running.
